# SAPAI Open

Paper-faithful open implementation of the **Statistical Analysis Plan AI (SAPAI)** pipeline.

This repository is the open companion to:

> Jafari H, Chu P, Lange M, Maher F, Glen C, Pearson O, Burges C, MacGregor L,
> Martyn M, Cross S, Carter B, Emsley R, Forbes G. *From Protocol to Analysis
> Plan: Development and Validation of a Large Language Model Pipeline for
> Statistical Analysis Plan Generation using Artificial Intelligence (SAPAI).*
> medRxiv 2026. <https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.03.19.26348626>

It implements the **section-by-section prompting pipeline** described in
the paper, using **only the prompts that were validated**, and supports the
three model families that the paper compared.

| Provider  | Paper-validated model       | Default temperature |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| OpenAI    | `gpt-5-2025-08-07`          | default (per paper) |
| Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`  | 0.2 (per paper)     |
| Google    | `gemini-2.5-pro`            | 0.2 (per paper)     |

## What this is

A minimal Streamlit app that:

1. accepts a user-supplied API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google;
2. ingests a clinical trial protocol (.pdf or .txt);
3. runs the section-by-section SAP generation prompts from the paper; and
4. returns a draft SAP as a `.docx`.

That's it. No autocoding, no chat refinement, no analysis-method extraction.
The KCL production app (`rct-sap-ai/sap-kcl`) does all of that — it iterates
freely without breaking this repo.

## What this is **not**

- Not the live, iterating KCL tool. That lives at
  <https://github.com/rct-sap-ai/sap-kcl> and serves the King's College London
  Clinical Trials Unit.
- Not a replacement for human statistical review. The paper makes the
  strong, evidence-based case that current LLMs are reliable for descriptive
  SAP content (~81–83% accuracy) but only ~67–72% accurate for items
  requiring statistical reasoning. **Every SAP generated here must be
  reviewed by a qualified trial statistician.**

## Provenance of the prompts

`sapai_open/prompts_paper_v1.py` is **byte-identical** to the prompts used
in the validation study (verified by SHA-256, see commit message of initial
commit). The source of record is:

> <https://github.com/rct-sap-ai/sapai-jama-sap-validation> · `Prompts/prompts_05.py`

This file is treated as frozen. Future versions of the prompts will be
published as `prompts_paper_v2.py`, `v3.py`, … without modifying the v1
file.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rct-sap-ai/sapai-open.git
cd sapai-open
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open <http://localhost:8501> and follow the two-step flow.

## Deployment

The hosted deployment lives at
<https://supportive-recreation-production.up.railway.app/>. Railway builds
from the (private) `rct-sap-ai/sapai-streamlit` repo, which depends on this
repo via `pip install git+https://github.com/rct-sap-ai/sapai-open.git@main`
in its `requirements.txt`. The production entry point is a thin shim:

```python
from sapai_open.app import main
main()
```

This means iterating on the open app is a normal commit-and-push to this
repo, followed by a `requirements.txt` SHA bump in `sapai-streamlit` to pick
up the new version.
